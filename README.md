# WiFi-Switch
WiFi-Switch is a wall outlet adapter which can be controlled through the home wierless network. It can turn On/Off any device which plugs into it.
This project is based on the ESP8266-01 module. Independent static-ip addresses can be use when deploying several switches around the house.
